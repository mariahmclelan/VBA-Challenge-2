# VBA-Challenge-2

I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock.


Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
